Text-Based game depicting the life of a character in the New York of the future

The idea is to create an immersive story set in the future that allows the player to create their own character and their own story. I aim to include at least 3 good endings and 3 bad endings that will be chosen for the player based off of their choices through out the story. The code itself should be easy to create however the intricacies of it all will come through when trying to connect the players choices to the ending they recieve. Any help on the project would be great. Thank you!
